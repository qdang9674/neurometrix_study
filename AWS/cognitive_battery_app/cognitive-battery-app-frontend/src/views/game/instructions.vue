        <p>The baseline assessment has concluded. Thank you for your patience.</p>
        <p>Next, you are going to play three rounds of three different games.</p>
        <p>You will be able to read the instructions for each game on the screen before starting. There will be a demo for each game that you can watch and repeat as many times as necessary until you understand how the game works.</p>
        <p>Some of the rounds will be more challenging than others. Please try your best and donâ€™t give up.</p>
        <p>In between each round, a brief set of questions will appear on the screen asking about your experience playing the game. Please answer each question as honestly as you can.</p>
